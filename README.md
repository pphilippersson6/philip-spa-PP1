# User Experience (UX)

## Wireframes

## Structure of the site

### Navigation Bar

- I decided to have the nav-bar on all three landingpages, because it looks more clean, and also is easier to navigate trought the website. 
- The logo is also a link, that will take you home to the first page. This helps anyone if they got confused, and want to start over. !

- ### Landing Page

- The homepage (landing page) have a big picture of a pool, with a text in it, to get visitors attention. The things i wanted to create was luxorious and relaxing content.

### The weekend package!

- The user will get two offers from whats discounted/announced right now.
- I have provided the two offers with a clickable picture, that will navigate them to a video of whats offered. 

 ### Footer section

- The footer have links to our social media, that will open up in a new tab in the browser. This is provided since they will klick at the links, and get more inspired to book a visit.
- The footer does also contain a contact us button, where the contact-email will open up in a new tab, or in the email application you're using.
- It also have a our service button to get navigated to what we offer. And this is a link to the about us section where the services are located.

 ### Booking

- The booking site contains a map from google, with the location of the spa. This allows the user to locate, and find us without any doubts.
- It also contains a text in a box, that reminds them to scroll down, to remove any distractions, and inform them that there is a contact form below.
- Contact form is located at the bottom of the page. The contact form is for book, or if any questions appear, navigating on the side.

 ### About Us
