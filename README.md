# User Experience (UX)

## Wireframe
- The wireframe for this website is designed in [Miro](https://miro.com/). There is a design that is represented on most devices. This was a design that was made in the beginning, so there are some minor differences. 
![Wireframe](readme-assets/images/wireframe.png)

## Structure of the site

Philip's Spa & Resort has three pages of content. The landingpage [Home](index.html) is the first page you will see. The other two pages are the [Booking](booking.html) and the [About Us](about-us.html). Here can you navigate to eighter get info about what content to expect, or you can fill in the contact form to get help by any questions.

## Color choice
I've chosen to use light colors on the background-color. This is to get a soft and relaxing feeling, to represent a feeling you want to achieve at a spa. It will blend in easily by the pictures i have chosen to use on my page.
I got the inspiration to find good color-matchings at the palettes by [mybrandnewlogo](https://mybrandnewlogo.com/)

# Testing

## Validator Testing
The codes have been tested by alot of aspects. One of the programs i used was the [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) This one checkt the HTML, and [Jigsaw W3C Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) checks the CSS.

- HTML check at the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fpphilippersson6.github.io%2Fphilip-spa-PP1%2F)
    - The first run showed me a small error - "Stray end tag". This was fixed evry simple, since i just had made two endtags. I removed the second endtag. ![Error on HTML validator](readme-assets/images/error1.png)
    - I made a second run to check that nothing else was appearing. 
        No errors was found when i tested it. ![Error fixed](readme-assets/images/no-error.png)

    - No errors was found here eighter, when i ran it trought the official [Jigsaw W3C validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fpphilippersson6.github.io%2Fphilip-spa-PP1%2F&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=sv) ![CSS Test](readme-assets/images/w3css-test.png)

    ## Lighthouse

## Responsive test (media)
- I have tested the site in developer-tools on google chrome. I made it responsive, so i could try all different sizes. My starting pixles was from 280px, and worked up to the biggest screen i could make, 2293 pixles. It's very responsive on those sizes.
- Down below, you can find some screenshots on the main - sizes i think is the most usable, to see its working all fine, and is very responsive.


 - Iphone SE (375x667px) SCREENSHOT!!!
 - Ipad Air (820x1180px) SCREENSHOT!!!
 - Ipad Mini (768x1024px) SCREENSHOT!!!
