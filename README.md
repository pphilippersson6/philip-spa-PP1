# Philips Spa & Resort!

This is a website for a luxurious Spa & Resort located in Sweden. Everyone needs some relaxing days once in a while. Then, you're at the right place!
This is a very easy-navigated website for the visitors to book visits and to get info about the spa in general.

# User Experience (UX)

## Wireframe
- The wireframe for this website is designed in [Miro](https://miro.com/). There is a design that is represented on most devices. This was a design that was made in the beginning, so there are some minor differences.

## Structure of the site

Philip's Spa & Resort has three pages of content. The landingpage [Home](index.html) is the first page you will see. The other two pages are the [Booking](booking.html) and the [About Us](about-us.html). Here can you navigate to eighter get info about what content to expect, or you can fill in the contact form to get help by any questions.

## Color choice
I've chosen to use light colors on the background-color. This is to get a soft and relaxing feeling, and it will blend in easily by the pictures i have chosen to use on my page.
I got the inspiration to find good color-matchings at the palettes by [mybrandnewlogo](https://mybrandnewlogo.com/)

### Navigation Bar

- I decided to have the nav-bar on all three landingpages, because it looks more clean, and also is easier to navigate trought the website. 
- The logo is also a link, that will take you home to the first page. This helps anyone if they got confused, and want to start over. !

- ### Landing Page

- The homepage (landing page) have a big picture of a pool, with a text in it, to get visitors attention. The things i wanted to create was luxorious and relaxing content.

### The weekend package!

- The user will get two offers from whats discounted/announced right now.
- I have provided the two offers with a clickable picture, that will navigate them to a video of whats offered. 

 ### Footer section

- The footer have links to our social media, that will open up in a new tab in the browser. This is provided since they will klick at the links, and get more inspired to book a visit.
- The footer does also contain a contact us button, where the contact-email will open up in a new tab, or in the email application you're using.
- It also have a our service button to get navigated to what we offer. And this is a link to the about us section where the services are located.

 ### Booking

- The booking site contains a map from google, with the location of the spa. This allows the user to locate, and find us without any doubts.
- It also contains a text in a box, that reminds them to scroll down, to remove any distractions, and inform them that there is a contact form below.
- Contact form is located at the bottom of the page. The contact form is for book, or if any questions appear, navigating on the side.

 ### About Us
- The about us page contains infomation of what services we offer.
- The pictures and the text information makes the visitors feel more comfortable. This is because they can both see, and read what we offer.

# Testing

## Validator Testing
The codes have been tested by alot of aspects. One of the programs i used was the [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) This one checkt the HTML, and [Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) checks the CSS.

- HTML check at the official [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fpphilippersson6.github.io%2Fphilip-spa-PP1%2F)
    - The first run showed me a small error - and this was fixed evry simple since i just forgot to close a tag.
    - I made a second run to check that nothing else was appearing. 
        No errors was found when i tested it.
